    "It is possible to use data such as the longitudes and latitudes of these sites to plot a visual representation of where they are on the Ghana map to make planning trips to Ghana easier. It can also help to spot what various places like restaurants, clubs, and other exciting places are around these sites which will make it easier for a tourist to select which sites to see. The data again allows a way to group the sites into categories as well and recommend which sites a customer would enjoy based on the category they select."
